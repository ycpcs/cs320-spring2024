He can be personally empathetic to students in private while still being a raging DICK in the classroom when its time to play 'Boss'. This role separation can't be easy to achieve so kudos on that just maybe dial back on the raging dick in the classroom.

On a personal level, can be very approachable. If you are having difficulties and need to talk, he is very approachable for students to talk to him and sets the mind games aside. Even though he's supposed to be our 'boss' this semester he can set that mentality aside in order to talk to us about our personal problems in the class.

Still doesn't budge on the questions you may have though, but he is very understanding of the stress and work load associated with the class.
