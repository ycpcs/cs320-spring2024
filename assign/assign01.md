**Due: [See Assignment Schedule](index.html)**

This is a **Team** assignment.

Project Proposal
================

Your main task this semester is to complete a semester-long team software project. Your task in this assignment is to form your team and decide what your project will be.

In a 3-4 page document, describe the following:

**Who are your team members?** You must have at least 3 but not more than 4.

**Briefly describe the system your team will create.** Please note the following important requirements:

1.  The system must be a web application, meaning that the user interface must be web-based.
2.  The system must store persistent data in a database.
3.  The system must be awesome when it is completed.

*Be ambitious*. The goal of this course is to learn how to design and build complex software. I do not expect that you will necessarily complete 100% of what you propose.

In your description of the system, include sketches of what the user interface will look like.

**What language(s) and programming environment will you use?** My **strong** recommendation is to use Java and Eclipse, using Java servlets and Java Server Pages (JSPs).  It is likely that you will end up using client-side JavaScript (JS), but we will NOT be covering that topic in this course.  JavaScript will provide a great opportunity for slef-learning.  I also strongly discourage attempting to implement a game (except for those included in the project suggestions), as previous history has shown that game development for this class has a low-rate (<5% chance) of success (creating an interesting, playable game).

I **strongly** recommend that you discuss your idea with me before you submit your proposal.

Here is the template for your [Team Project Proposal](CS320_Team_Project_Proposal_Template.pdf).  Download the [template document](CS320_Team_Project_Proposal_Template.docx), modify it, as necessary, and follow the submission instructions below.

Submitting
==========

Have one team member create a Google Team Drive folder named "CS320-Sp22-Team-www-xxx-yyy-zzz", replacing "www-xxx-yyy-zzz" with the YCP user names of the members of your project team, **in alphabetical order**.  Share the Team Drive and all of its folders  and contents with your team and me.

This folder will be your means of submission for all **non-programming-related team** assignments.

Then create your Team Project Proposal in that folder, using Google Docs.  Name your Project Proposal document **assign01-www-xxx-yyy-zzz**, again substituting the YCP user names of your project team members, **in alphabetical order**.
