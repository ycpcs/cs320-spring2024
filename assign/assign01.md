**Due: [See Assignment Schedule](index.html)**

This is a **Team** assignment.

Team Project Proposal
=====================

Your main task this semester is to complete a semester-long team software project. Your task in this assignment is to form your team and decide what your project will be.

Select one of the projects from the list of [Team Projects](../projects/index.html).

If you and your team want to tackle a project not on that list, you and your team will have to provide me with compelling evidence that your entire team is up to the task, as I (and the class tutors) will not be able to provide your team with as much guidance throughout the semester as you would get for one of the standard projects.

In a 3-4 page document, describe the following:

**Who is on your team?** You will be choosing your own teams.  You must have at least 3, but not more than 4 team members.  All team members must be from the same section of CS320

**Briefly describe the system your team will create.** Please note the following important requirements:

1.  The system must be a web application, meaning that the user interface must be web-based.
2.	The system must have a client-server architecture, i.e., a browser-based web front-end and remote server back-end.
2.  The system must store persistent data in a SQL database located on the server side.
3.  The system must be **awesome** when it is completed.

*Be ambitious*. The goal of this course is to learn how to design and build complex software. I do not expect that you will necessarily complete 100% of what you propose.  In fact, I have only ever had one team "complete" a project, and it WAS awesome.

In your description of the system, include sketches of what the user interface will look like.

**What language(s) and programming environment will you use?** You will be using Java and Eclipse, with Java servlets and Java Server Pages (JSPs).  It is likely that you will end up using client-side JavaScript (JS), but we will NOT be covering that topic in this course.  JavaScript will provide a great opportunity for self-learning.  I also strongly discourage attempting to implement a game (except for those included in the project suggestions), as previous history has shown that game development for this class has a low-rate (<5% chance) of success (creating an interesting, playable, graphical game).

I **strongly** recommend that you discuss your idea with me before you submit your proposal.

Submitting
==========

Have one team member create a shared Google document for your team project proposal and name it "**assign01-www-xxx-yyy-zzz**", replacing "www-xxx-yyy-zzz" with the YCP usernames of the members of your project team, **in alphabetical order**.  Share your proposal document and contents with your team **and with me.**

After you have finished your proposal, save it as a PDF file and then submit the PDF version to Marmoset under the "**Assign01: Team Project Proposal**" project.  Only one team member should submit the document.

<div class="callout">
<b>Important: Only submissions in PDF form will be accepted.</b>  Do not submit a document in any other format, i.e., do <b>NOT</b> submit a Google or Word doc - save it in PDF form first, and submit the PDF version to Marmoset.  Make sure to follow the specified naming conventions for your proposal document!
</div>

After you submit your team project proposal, I will create a shared Google folder for your team project and then share that folder with you and your team.  The folder will be named **"CS320-Sp24-Team-www-xxx-yyy-zzz"** with your usernames substituted as above.  That folder will then be your means of submission for all **non-programming-related team** assignments.  After you have been granted access to that folder, please copy both versions of your Team Project Proposal (Google Doc and PDF) to that folder.


<!-- Commenting out - submissions will now be in Marmoset as a PDF
Have one team member create a Google shared folder for your team named "CS320-Sp24-Team-www-xxx-yyy-zzz", replacing "www-xxx-yyy-zzz" with the YCP user names of the members of your project team, **in alphabetical order**.  Share the folder and contents with your team **and with me.**

This folder will be your means of submission for all **non-programming-related team** assignments.

Then create your Team Project Proposal in that folder, using Google Docs.  Name your Project Proposal document **assign01-www-xxx-yyy-zzz**, again substituting the YCP user names of your project team members, **in alphabetical order**.  

<div class="callout">
<b>Important</b>: Only submissions in Google Docs will be accepted.
Do not submit a document in any other format, i.e., do NOT submit a Word doc - convert it to a Google Doc first)!
