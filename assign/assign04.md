title: "Assignment 4: Individual Project Milestones"
---

In the [Schedule](../schedule.html) you will notice days designated as individual project milestones.  These are opportunities for you to demonstrate progress on your individual project.

This document describes the expectations for each milestone.

**Important**: For each milestone, make sure you come to class prepared to demonstrate your work.  If there is any hardware or software you need, it is your responsibility to make sure it is available and working.

**Regarding vidoes:** You will be presenting an in-person demo to me in class.  You are permited to make a back-up video in-case something goes wrong with your in-person presentation, but **DO NOT** rely on your demo as your first line of presentation.  If you cannot transport your developent environment and/or hardware to the classroom, bring a video of your working demonstration.  You will still be required to present and discuss your demo in-person, as well as answer questions about it.

**Important**: Each individual milestone demo can be no longer than 3-4 minutes (in order for me to see all of the demos during class.)

> Due Date | Milestone

## Expectations

**Milestone 1: Baseline Prototype**.  First, you will need to demonstrate that you have installed all of the tools you need to develop your project: IDEs, packages, libraries, etc.  if you are working with hardware, you will need to ahve your components.  You should also be ready to demonstrate some concrete progress on your project in the form of a basic prototype.  The prototype should support some of the functionality described in your proposal, but it can be in a very basic form.  if you are working in Unity or Unreal, at a minimum, you should be able to demonsrate that you have successfully completed a working tutorial and discuss your next steps for Milestone 2.

**Milestone 2: 50% Progress**: For this milestone, you should be about half of the way towards completion of the project.  There should be some substantial progress towards completing the proposed work.

**Milestone 3: Final Project Demo**. This is the completed project.
