Problem Domain Analysis
=======================

In this assignment, your team will conduct an analysis of the problem domain of your team project, and build an analysis model of the problem domain.

Step 1: Textual Analysis
------------------------

Go through the requirements and use cases you wrote in [Assignment 5](assign05.html). Identify the important noun and verb phrases which describe entities and concepts in your problem domain.  Save these in a document.

Step 2: Build an Analysis Model
-------------------------------

Based on your textual analysis, construct a UML class diagram modeling your project's problem domain.

You will probably want to work with your group using a whiteboard, since problem domain analysis is a *process*.  Your group will undoubtedly make a number of changes to the UML diagram as you explore possible ways of modeling the problem domain.

While your group is creating its UML diagram, create an electronic version of the diagram using a drawing package such as:
>	[Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)

>	[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

>	[Draw.io online version](https://app.diagrams.net/)

>	[Draw.io downloadable version)](https://www.drawio.com/)


Use **Associations (plain, aggregation, composition)** and **Generalizations (Is-A / inheritance)** to show the relationships between the **Classes (noun phrases)** in your model. Give each association a name to indicate the roles of the two classes involved in the association. Indicate **multiplicity** in your associations that are NOT 1-to-1.  Add the **important methods (verb phrases)** to the classes to which they are most likely to belong. If you already know them, specifying the parameters and return types for the methods.  Do **NOT** include your constructors, getters, and setters in your Class diagrams - encapsulation is assumed to exist.

> **Note**: Because you are building an analysis model, avoid modeling any "implementation" classes such as those involved in the user interface, data storage, etc., unless there are important requirements which would not otherwise be addressed by the model.

Step 3: Explain the Model
-------------------------

In the description portion of the document, *briefly* (1-2 pages) explain your analysis model. Discuss why you felt the classes you modeled are the most important ones. Is there a class or classes that seem to be "central" to the model? How did you determine where to put the important methods?

Submitting
==========

Create an Analysis and Design document for your project in Google Docs that includes your group's Textual Analysis, UML Model Diagram, and an explanation of your Analysis Model.  Name the document **assign06-www-xxx-yyy-zzz**, substituting the YCP user names of your project team members,**in alphabetical order**.

Place your Analysis document under your Google shared Group Project folder.  Also post your UML Diagam file(s) of your Analysis Model to the Group Project folder.

Also save a PDF version of your Google document using the same naming format and submit it to Marmoset under the **Assign06: Team Problem Domain Analysis** project.

<div class="callout">
<b>Important</b>: Your submission <i>must</i> be a Google Doc, shared via your Group Project folder.

<b>AND</b> you must also submit a <b>PDF</b> version of that document to Marmoset.  Do not submit a file in any other format.
