# WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

As such, some of the links below could return 404 Page Not Found Errors.  Professor Hake will be developing the course website over Semester Break.  If you would like to see what the organization and content of a previous CS320 class looked like (and what you are getting yourself into), go to [CS320-Spring2024](https://ycpcs.github.io/cs320-spring2024).  The Spring 2025 CS320 course will be somewhat different, but will contain all of the content, labs, assignments, projects, and expected outcomes from the Spring 2024 course.

* **Apr 22** - [Assignment 10](assign/assign10.html) is an individual reflection on the team project.  [Assignment 11](assign/assign11.html) is a self/peer evaluation for the team project.  They are both INDIVIDUAL assignments and are are both **due by 7:00am, Sunday, 5-8-22 in PDF form in Marmoset**.

* **Apr 22** - [Assignment 8](assign/assign08.html) describes the final deliverables for the team project.  There are several - please read the assignment carefully.

* **Apr 13** - [Team Project Milestone 3: 75% Working System, w/SQL DB](assign/assign03.html) is **due Monday, 4-25-22**.  This will be a FORMAL 8-10 minute (max) team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress since milestone 2.  SQL database functionality **IS REQUIRED** for this milestone.  A large majority of your classes, methods, test cases, and web page navigation should be implemented by milestone 3, as well.

* **Apr 13** - [Assignment 9](assign/assign09.html) describes the deliverables for the individual project.  The due date for you individual project report has been moved to **Friday, 4-22-22, by 7:00am**.

* **Apr 13** - [Individual Project Milestone 3](assign/assign04.html) is due **Wednesday, 4-20-22**.  This will be your final informal (at your desk) 2-4 minute (max) in-class demonstration of your individual project.

* **Apr 3** - Posted an extensive example project on the [Resources page](./resources) that incorporates the Web Applications lab solution (Lab02) with the ORM Lab solution (Lab06).  It provides a web application front-end to the ORM queries, as well as demonstrates the use of login session information, and incorporation of a SQL database persistence layer with a many-to-many relationship. We will review this in more depth in class on **Wednesday, 4-6-22**.

* **Mar 30** - The **midterm exam** will be a take-at-home exam that I will hand out in class on **Wednesday, 4-6-22**.  You will turn it back in to me at the beginning of your class period on **Friday, 4-8-22**.  There is NO Programming portion, it is all written.  You will also need to create a UML diagram (either using a drawing package, or a NEATLY hand-drawn diagram).  The exam will be open notes and you can use any resource on the CS320 website, as well as your assignment and lab solutions.  The exam is 120 points, and was originally designed to be an in-class 50-minute exam, with a built-in curve of 20 points.  Since this is now a take home exam, there is no practice exam posted, nor will there be a review for the exam.  Taking the exam at home IS the review.   **YOU MUST DO YOUR OWN WORK - YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CONSULT WITH ANYONE ELSE, OR USE ANY RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT LISTED ON THE RESOURCES PAGE OF THE CS320 WEBSITE.  I AM TRUSTING YOU TO WORK ON YOUR HONOR - PLEASE DO NOT BETRAY THAT TRUST.**

* **Mar 29** - A solution to [Lab05: JDBC](labs/lab05.html) will be posted to the [Resources page](./resources) on Wednesday morning (3-30-22), so that you can have a common code base to work from for [Lab06: ORM](labs/lab06.html).  No submissions for Lab05 will be accepted for credit after the Lab05 solution is posted.

* **Mar 23** - Please review the updated Course Calendar.  The Individual and Team Project Milestone 3 presentation dates have been pushed to later in the semester, and certain lectures have been moved around in their places.

* **Mar 22** - [Lab04: SQL, Queries, Joins](labs/lab04.html) is now **due for full credit credit by 7:00am, Thursday, 3-24-22**.  If you submit by the **original due date, 7:00am, Wednesday, 3-23-22, you will receive 110% credit (10% extra credit)**.  Make sure to use the template for your Lab04 submission. See the instructions on the Lab04 page.

* **Mar 18** - [Lab06: ORM](labs/lab06.html) is posted.  It is due **7:00am, Saturday, 4-2-22 for 10% extra credit** OR **by 7:00am, Sunday, 4-3-22 for full credit**.

You can download the jarfile from the [Resources Page](resources/index.html).  You may also use other drawing tools, **as long as those tools can export PDF, PNG, or JPG versions of the UML diagram**, which you willl need to embed in your Assign06 submission.

* **Feb 21** - [Assignment 5: Team Use Cases](assign/assign05.html) is **due by 7:00am, Wednesday, 3-2-22**.  You will need it for the in-class exercise for the Textual Analysis of your team project Use Cases later that day.

* **Feb 3** - [Lab02: Web Applications I](labs/lab02.html) is posted.  It is simply an introduction to Web Applications, and will ease you into Lab02a.  It is not required, but it will give you a good start on Lab02a.  Please also see the [Java and Eclipse Installation Instructions](labs/Eclipse-Java-Installation.html) for additional information about setting up your development environment for the labs.
