Introduction
============

What is the course about?

-   The *practice* of software development
-   All the things you need to know to

    -   Figure out what a system should do (requirements)
    -   Define and analyze the problem (analysis)
    -   Design a system to solve the problem (design)
    -   Implement the design (implementation)
    -   Ensure the quality of the implementation (testing, code review)
    -   Work in a collaborative team environment
	-	Share code (version control - shared code base and issue tracking)
    -   Planning and estimation (how long will it take?)

The course will focus on *object-oriented* software development

-   The techniques can be adapted for non object-oriented languages

Course will emphasize *agile* software development

-   Agile software development is an *incremental* development process
-   Develop the system a little bit at a time
-   The idea is to make steady progress
-   The system is stable and functional at all times
-   Don't wait until the end of the project to "see if it works"
