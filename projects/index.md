This page lists the possible team projects for this semester.  Pick one of these projects to work on as a team.  Please see your instructor for more details.

* [CHESS](MKiley_Chess_Project.pdf): An interactive, multi-player chess game.

* [Text-Based Adventure Game (TBAG)](Text_Adventure_Game.html): Text-based adventure games (TBAG) were the first interactive computer games.

* [RevMetrix UI and Database](RevMetrix.html): The [RevMetrix Project](https://docs.revmetrix.io) is a new multi-year, multi-disciplinary Capstone project that was just started this past Fall semester by a team of 12 students in CS 400 (CS Capstone).  The project is the brain child of both Professor Hake and Dr. Babcock from previous research they conducted and personal projects that they developed.  The intent with offering CS320 students the opportunity to work on the RevMetrix project is to grant the opportunity to spin-up on a faculty-collaborative research project, while also interacting with CS Capstone seniors.

**NOTE** If you (and your entire team) have a strong desire to propose and tackle a project of your own choosing, and your **entire team** can demonstrate sufficient compentancy to me, I will give your proposal consideration.  NOTE: Consideration is not a guarantee for approval.  Talk to me early, before your submit your proposal.
